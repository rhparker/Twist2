\opening{Dear Editor,}

On behalf of my co-authors, Yannan Shen, Alejandro Aceves, and John Zweck, I would like to submit the article ``Spatiotemporal dynamics in a twisted, circular waveguide array'' for consideration of publication in Studies in Applied Mathematics. In this article, we study the existence and spectral stability of nonlinear discrete localized solutions representing light pulses propagating in a twisted multi-core optical fiber. Of note, asymptotic expansions are obtained for these solutions which are in very good agreement with results of numerical computations. This work has not been published elsewhere.


\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
